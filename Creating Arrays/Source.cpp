float studentHeight [];

//b. age of parents

int parentalAges [];

//c. true of false questions

bool questionList[];

//d. letters of the alphabet

//2. What is the size in memory of the following arrays
//a. 
float heights[5];

//The memory size is 20 bytes.

//b. 
int ages[10];

//The memory size is 40 bytes.

//c. 
char letters[26];

//the memory size is 26 bytes.

//3. Declare an array with the values 1 - 10;

int 

//4. Using the array created in problem 3 print the 5th index.



//5. Using a loop, populate an array of size 10 with the values 10 - 1.



//6. Create a an array of size five then ask the user to input five 
//number into the array. Display the largest and smallest numbers 
//to the console.



//7. Create a program that creates a small 3x3 array of integers.Use a nested for 
//loop to initialise the numbers 1 - 9. Output the numbers in a grid format.
