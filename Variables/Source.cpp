#include <iostream>

void main()
{
	//You can not print to the console unless the problem specifies.

	//1. Select suitable variable types and names for the following examples
	//a) The average height of students in your class
	float avgHeight = 5.5f;
	//b) The tax rate for incomes over $65000
	int taxRate = 'a' >= 65000;
	//c) The tax rate for incomes below $5000
	int taxRate2 = 'b' >= 5000;
	//d) The total cost of all the games on your Steam library
	float stmLibrary = 47.08;

	//2. Select suitable data types to hold the following values :
	//a) 121
	int ctMeter = 121;
	//b) 9.4
	float ftHeight = 9.4f;
	//c) r
	char footHeight = 'r';
	//d) 100000
	int milliMeter = 100000;
	//e) False
	bool False;

	//3. Create a program that swaps two numbers. Ask the user for 2 numbers in the console window
	//and store the result in variables called “a” and “b” print the result to screen.Write code 
	//that swaps the values for these variables, then print the variables “a” and “b” again.
	//You should comment your code.

	int a;
	int b;
	a = b; //this makes the two values equal.
	b = a; //this swaps the values.
	int c = a + b;
	
		


	//4. Ask the user for 5 numbers and output the average of these numbers.	
	int f;
	int g;
	int h;
	int i;
	int j;  //these variabl;es are all separate numbers
	(f * g * h * i * j) / (f + g + h + i + j) //this is the equation of averages with the variable numbers inside
	
		
	//5. Redo question 3 but allows the user to input the values to be swapped and provide information
	//in the console proving the data was swapped.
